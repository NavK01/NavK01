## 🚀 Projects

### 🩺 Medical Chatbot (Deployed on AWS)
- Trained a mental health chatbot on AWS SageMaker using LLMs models.
- Deployed using real-time interaction and empathetic responses.
- Integrated into a responsive web UI with animations and conversational flow.

### 🔍 Touchless Fingerprint Scanner
- Developed a fingerprint segmentation system using YOLOv11.
- Extracted and segmented fingerprint patterns from finger images (touchless acquisition).
- Conducted ongoing research on biometric extraction for enhanced accuracy.

### 🧠 LLM Training & Deployment
- Trained large language models locally and on AWS with custom datasets.
- Focused on fine-tuning models for domain-specific tasks (e.g., medical conversations).
- Developed APIs using FastAPI for scalable and fast inference.

### 🔊 Real-Time TTS (Text-to-Speech)
- Built streaming TTS systems for real-time audio generation from text.
- Optimized for low latency and smooth interaction in chatbot interfaces.
